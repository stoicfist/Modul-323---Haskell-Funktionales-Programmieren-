# m323 - Haskell and Functional Programming

This repository contains my weekly tasks and exercises for the m323 module on Haskell and functional programming.

## Structure

The repository is organized by weeks, with each week containing its own set of tasks and exercises:

```

└── project/
```

## About

This module covers fundamental concepts of functional programming using Haskell, including:
- Functional programming principles
- Pure functions and immutability
- Higher-order functions
- Type systems and type inference
- Recursion and pattern matching
- Monads and functors

Each week directory contains exercises, examples, and solutions related to the topics covered during that week.
